"""Compoundable-moment detection for the learn-capture Stop hook.

A Stop hook fires at the end of *every* turn, so detection must be cheap and
conservative — most turns contain no durable lesson and must yield nothing. When
a signal *is* present, the hook stages a single draft stub for later approval via
`/learn-capture --review`; it never writes a real learning and never touches the
index. (Approval-gated capture is the locked design.)

Signals, strongest first:
- **correction** — explicit user-correction language in the transcript ("no,
  that's wrong", "don't do that"). The highest-value lesson: a mistake not to
  repeat.
- **playbook** — a user-blessed procedure ("that worked", "ship it").
- **insight** — a bug→fix arc visible in recent commit subjects (fix/revert).

The bash hook gathers recent git subjects + a transcript tail and calls
`detect_signal`; this module owns the (testable) decision.
