## Definition

Scaling laws describe the empirical power-law relationships between neural network performance (typically measured by test loss) and key scaling factors: model size (parameters), dataset size (tokens), and compute budget (FLOPs).

## Context

First systematically characterized by Kaplan et al. (2020) at OpenAI, scaling laws have become a foundational tool for predicting model performance and allocating training compute efficiently. The Chinchilla study by Hoffmann et al. (2022) at Google DeepMind refined the optimal allocation ratio.
