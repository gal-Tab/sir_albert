## Overview

This paper by Kaplan et al. at OpenAI characterizes the power-law relationships between model performance and scale factors (parameters, data, compute).

## Key Claims

- Test loss follows smooth power-law relationships with model size, dataset size, and compute.
- Model size is the most important factor for a fixed compute budget.
- These scaling laws hold over many orders of magnitude.

## Evidence/Data

Experiments spanning models from 768 to 1.5 billion parameters, trained on 22 million to 23 billion tokens.

## Limitations

- Focused on autoregressive language models only.
- Did not explore compute-optimal allocation as thoroughly as later work (Chinchilla).
