# Compile Knowledge Base Sources

Process all uncompiled or updated files in `raw/` through the extraction and compilation pipeline. Dispatches background agents for parallel source extraction, then collects and deduplicates entity/concept candidates in code before resolving them in a single LLM pass per batch.

---

## Step 1: Read State

Read three files and hold their contents — they're needed throughout compilation:

1. `wiki-schema.md` — domain rules (embedded in worker prompts)
2. `raw/.manifest.json` — pipeline state
3. `wiki/index.md` — existing wiki pages

---

## Step 2: Identify Files to Process

From the manifest, identify files that need work:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| File in `raw/` but not in manifest | New file — extract and compile |
| `status: "extracted"` with `compiled_at: null` | Interrupted compilation — resume from source page creation |
| `status: "compiled"` but sha256 differs from current file | Updated file — re-extract and re-compile |
| `status: "failed"` | Previously failed — retry |

If no files need processing, tell the user `"All files are up to date."` and stop.

**Repo ingestion:** Repos are NOT dropped into `raw/` as files. When the user asks to ingest a repo, use `tools/extract-repo.sh <url-or-path> raw/.extracted/{name}.extracted.md` directly. Track by URL or path as the manifest key instead of a filename.

Tell the user: `"Found N file(s) to compile: file1.md, file2.pdf"`

---

## Step 3: Dependency Pre-Check

Before any extraction, verify required tools per file format:

| Extension | Check command | Skip message |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `.pdf` | `python3 -c "import pymupdf4llm"` | `"Skipping {file}: pymupdf4llm not installed. Run: pip3 install --user pymupdf4llm"` |
| repo | `command -v repomix` or `command -v npx` | `"Skipping {file}: repomix not found. Run: npm install -g repomix"` |
| `.md`, `.txt` | (none) | N/A |

Remove failing files from the work list. If all files fail dep checks, report and stop.

Tell the user: `"Dependencies OK. Starting compilation..."`

---

## Step 4: Dispatch Workers

Create the results directory:

```bash
mkdir -p raw/.compile-results
```

For each file, check its size to inform the worker's reading strategy:

```bash
python3 -c "import os; s=os.path.getsize('raw/{file}'); print('small' if s<80000 else 'medium' if s<250000 else 'large')"
```

For each file, spawn one background agent:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  model="sonnet",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="[Worker prompt — see Step 4a below, with all {placeholders} filled]"
)
```

Issue ALL Agent calls in a single message for parallel execution.

Tell the user:
- 1 file: `"Compiling {filename} in background. You can continue working."`
- N files: `"Compiling {N} files in parallel. You can continue working."`

**Fallback — Agent tool unavailable:** If the Agent tool is not available, process files sequentially in the main process. For each file, run the extraction (Step 4a parts 1-3) directly, then continue to Step 6 for entity resolution. This re-introduces source tokens into the main context window — this is the known limitation from before this change.

### Step 4a: Worker Prompt

This is the complete prompt embedded in each Agent call. Fill all `{placeholders}` with actual values before dispatching.

```
You are a knowledge base compilation worker. Your job: extract ONE source file, read it, and create a source summary page. You do NOT create entity or concept pages. You do NOT touch the index, manifest, or git.

## Domain Rules

{Insert the full text of wiki-schema.md here}

## Your Assignment

- Source file: raw/{filename}
- File format: {pdf|md|txt}
- Project directory: {absolute path to project root}
- Extract tool path: {absolute path to tools/extract-pdf.py or tools/extract-repo.sh}
- Estimated source size: {small|medium|large}

## Instructions

### 1. Extract

Run the appropriate extraction command:

For PDF:
  python3 {project}/tools/extract-pdf.py {project}/raw/{filename} {project}/raw/.extracted/{basename}.extracted.md

For markdown/text:
  cp {project}/raw/{filename} {project}/raw/.extracted/{basename}.extracted.md

For repo:
  {project}/tools/extract-repo.sh {url-or-path} {project}/raw/.extracted/{name}.extracted.md

Compute the sha256 hash of the original source file:
  shasum -a 256 {project}/raw/{filename} | cut -d' ' -f1

If extraction fails, write a failure result (see step 4) and stop.

### 2. Read the Extracted Content

Read the extracted markdown from raw/.extracted/{basename}.extracted.md.

**Size-aware reading strategy:**

First, check the file size:
  python3 -c "import os; print(os.path.getsize('{project}/raw/.extracted/{basename}.extracted.md'))"

**Under 80KB (~20K tokens):** Read the full file in one call.

**80KB-250KB (~20K-60K tokens):** Read in chunks using the Read tool's offset/limit parameters. Read 2000 lines per call. Process all chunks — you have context capacity for this.

**Over 250KB (~60K+ tokens):** Selective reading. Do NOT attempt to read the full file.
  1. Read the first 500 lines (introduction, abstract, overview)
  2. Use Grep to find heading patterns and get the document structure:
       Pattern: "^#" in file raw/.extracted/{basename}.extracted.md
  3. Read the key sections: introduction, conclusion/summary, results/findings, methodology (by offset/limit targeting the line numbers from step 2)
  4. Summarize based on selective reading. Note in the source page: "Source summarized via selective reading (document exceeds 60K tokens)."

This ensures quality degrades gracefully rather than failing silently on large documents.

### 3. Create the Source Page

Create wiki/sources/{slug}.md following the source page template from the domain rules above.

Slug derivation:
- Papers/articles: abbreviated title, lowercase, hyphens. "Attention Is All You Need" → attention-is-all-you-need
- Books: author-lastname-short-title. "Deep Learning by Goodfellow" → goodfellow-deep-learning
- Repos: repo name. github.com/user/my-tool → my-tool
- General docs: descriptive short name. company-overview.md → company-overview

Source page structure: follow the sections in the domain rules (Overview, Key Claims, Evidence/Data, Limitations, Cross-References). Keep under 1500 words — summarize aggressively for longer sources.

At the bottom of the source page, add this temporary section:

## Extracted References
- Entity: {Name} — {one-line description} (type: {person|org|product|place|tool|project})
- Concept: {Name} — {one-line description}

Entity extraction rules:
- Only entities central to the source's thesis, not merely cited
- Multi-author papers: at most 3 authors (first author + most notable co-authors)
- Organizations: only if they produced or funded the work

Concept extraction rules:
- Only domain-specific, novel, or defined-by-source concepts
- Skip widely-known general concepts unless the source offers novel treatment
- If the domain description above is blank/general, only extract concepts coined or defined by the source

### 3b. Create Full-Source Preservation (Candlekeep Hybrid)

After creating the source summary page, preserve the original document structure for deep citation:

1. Create directory: `wiki/full-sources/{slug}/`

2. Generate `wiki/full-sources/{slug}/toc.md` — a table of contents built from the extracted document's headings:
   ```markdown
   # {Source Title} — Table of Contents
   
   - [Page 1](page-1.md) — {first heading or "Introduction"}
   - [Page 2](page-2.md) — {heading at start of page 2}
   ...
   ```

3. Split the extracted content into `wiki/full-sources/{slug}/page-{N}.md` files, each ~2000 words (split at heading boundaries when possible). Each page preserves the original text verbatim — no summarization.

4. Add to the source summary page frontmatter: `full_source: "full-sources/{slug}/"`

This is additive — the wiki summary still works as before, but agents can "drill down" to original text when the summary isn't sufficient.

**Skip this step if the extracted content is under 500 words** (no benefit to pagination for short documents).

### 4. Write Result File

Write a JSON file to raw/.compile-results/{slug}.json with this exact structure:

{
  "source_file": "{filename}",
  "slug": "{slug}",
  "source_page": "wiki/sources/{slug}.md",
  "status": "success",
  "error": null,
  "sha256": "{hash from step 1}",
  "extracted_at": "{ISO 8601 timestamp}"
}

If extraction or compilation failed, write:
{
  "source_file": "{filename}",
  "slug": "{slug or basename}",
  "source_page": null,
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "{what went wrong}",
  "sha256": null,
  "extracted_at": null
}

You are done. Do not update wiki/index.md, raw/.manifest.json, or make any git commits.
```

---

## Step 5: Collect Results

After all agents complete, read each result file from `raw/.compile-results/`:

```
Glob: raw/.compile-results/*.json
```

For each result file, read the JSON. Expected structure:

```json
{
  "source_file": "paper.pdf",
  "slug": "attention-is-all-you-need",
  "source_page": "wiki/sources/attention-is-all-you-need.md",
  "status": "success",
  "error": null,
  "sha256": "abc123...",
  "extracted_at": "2026-04-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**If a result file is missing:** Glob for `wiki/sources/*.md` files that weren't there before dispatch. If a source page exists without a result JSON, treat as success with unknown metadata and log a warning.

**If `status: "failed"`:** Log the failure. Set the file's manifest entry to `"failed"` with the error message. Continue with successful files.

### 5a: Validate Source Pages (pre-write gate)

For each successful result, validate the worker-produced source page before accepting it:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_wiki.py wiki/sources/{slug}.md
```

If exit code is non-zero, the worker produced a malformed page. Treat this as `status: "failed_validation"`:
- Do NOT advance the manifest entry to `compiled` for this file
- Do NOT include this source in Step 6 candidate collection
- Log the validator's stdout (it lists the specific schema violations) so the user can re-run extraction with a corrected worker prompt

Track the set of source pages that passed validation — only those participate in Step 6.

Tell the user per file:
- Success: `"Extracted: {filename} → {source_page}"`
- Failure (extraction): `"Failed: {filename} — {error}"`
- Failure (validation): `"Failed validation: {filename} — see validator output above"`

**If ALL files failed (extraction or validation):** Update the manifest with failure statuses (Step 8b), report failures (Step 10), and stop. Do not attempt entity resolution, link validation, or git commit — there are no wiki pages to process.

---

## Step 6: Entity/Concept Resolution

Batch resolution: collect all candidates from source pages, deduplicate in code, classify against existing wiki, then resolve in a single LLM pass per batch.

### 6a: Collect and Classify

Run the resolution script to parse, deduplicate, and classify all candidates as a structured JSON brief (one envelope per batch, NDJSON):

```bash
python3 tools/resolve_candidates.py wiki/ raw/.compile-results/ raw/.manifest.json \
  --batch-size 5 --max-candidates 30 --format=json
```

Capture stdout. Each non-empty line is a JSON envelope with this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "wiki_index": "...",
  "batch": {
    "create": [{"kind": "entity|concept", "name": "...", "slug": "...",
                "entity_type": "person|org|...", "attestations": [
                  {"source_slug": "...", "claim": "..."}
                ]}],
    "update": [{...with "existing_slug": "..."}],
    "skip":   [...],
    "stale":  [{"slug": "...", "page": "...", "reason": "..."}]
  },
  "format_contract": {
    "source_refs": "...",
    "links": "...",
    "see_also": "...",
    "frontmatter_required": [...]
  }
}
```

If stdout is empty (all candidates are SKIPs or no Extracted References found), tell the user `"All entities/concepts already up to date."` and skip to Step 7.

For each line (one batch), process via Step 6b sequentially.

### 6b: Resolve (one LLM call per batch, validated writes)

For each batch envelope, dispatch the resolver with the JSON brief as the variable tail. The cacheable prefix is static across batches.

**Prompt structure:**

```
[CACHEABLE PREFIX]

You are resolving entity and concept candidates into wiki pages. All candidates
have been pre-classified — follow the classification exactly. The format
contract in the brief is enforced by a pre-write validator: pages that violate
it will be rejected and you will be re-prompted with the validator's errors.

## Domain Rules

{Insert full text of wiki-schema.md}

## Resolution Instructions

For each CREATE candidate in batch.create:
  - Generate the full page (frontmatter + sections + `## See Also` with [CONFIDENCE] labels).
  - Write to `wiki/{entities|concepts}/{slug}.md` using the Write tool.
  - Cross-reference other candidates in this batch freely — they will all exist after this pass.
  - Apply the format_contract literally:
      source_refs: list of {slug, confidence} OBJECTS (not plain strings)
      links: relative `../{category}/{slug}.md` only (NOT [[wiki-links]])
      see_also: every line ends with [STATED|INFERRED|UNCERTAIN]

For each UPDATE candidate in batch.update:
  - Read the existing page at `wiki/{category}/{existing_slug}.md`.
  - Append the new source to source_refs frontmatter (object form).
  - Add a bullet under Source Appearances with the new source context.
  - Extend `## See Also` if the new source reveals new relationships.
  - Use Edit (never rewrite).
  - On contradiction: **[Contradiction]** Source A claims X, but Source B claims Y.

For STALE entries: no action — logged for human review.

After all writes, output a decision summary, one line per candidate:
  {name} | {action: created|updated|skipped} | {reason}

[VARIABLE TAIL]

## Resolution Brief (this batch)

{Insert the JSON envelope for this batch}
```

### 6b-validate: Pre-write gate

After the resolver returns, validate every page it touched in this batch:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_wiki.py {space-separated paths from batch.create + batch.update}
```

If exit code is 0, the batch is clean — proceed to 6c.

If exit code is non-zero, capture the validator's stdout (lists per-path errors) and **dispatch a single retry** with this prompt:

```
The resolver writes for this batch failed format validation. Re-write only
the pages listed below with the violations corrected. Do not touch any other
pages. The format_contract is the same as before; pay special attention to
the listed errors.

## Failed pages and errors

{paste validator stdout verbatim}

## Original brief (for context)

{re-insert the same JSON envelope}
```

After the retry, re-run validate_wiki.py on the same paths. Pages that still fail are quarantined:

For each still-failing page `wiki/{category}/{slug}.md`:

```bash
# Save the failing content to a temp file
cp wiki/{category}/{slug}.md /tmp/q-content.md
# Save the errors as a JSON list
python3 tools/validate_wiki.py wiki/{category}/{slug}.md > /tmp/q-errors.txt 2>&1 || true
# Move to quarantine and revert the wiki file from git (or rm if it was a CREATE)
python3 tools/quarantine_page.py move \
  wiki/{category}/{slug}.md /tmp/q-content.md /tmp/q-errors.txt --wiki-root wiki
git checkout wiki/{category}/{slug}.md 2>/dev/null || rm -f wiki/{category}/{slug}.md
```

Tell the user per quarantined page:
`"Quarantined: wiki/{category}/{slug}.md — see wiki/.quarantine/{category}/{slug}.errors.json"`

### 6c: Clean Up and Trace

After resolution + validation completes:

1. Remove `## Extracted References` from each source page (Edit out the section)
2. Capture the LLM's decision summary lines and write to `raw/.compile-results/resolution-trace.json`. Include validation outcomes per page (`validated|retried|quarantined`):

```json
{
  "batch": 1,
  "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
  "candidates_in": 18,
  "decisions": [
    {"name": "Entity Name", "type": "entity", "action": "created",
     "reason": "central to 2 sources", "sources": ["src-a", "src-b"],
     "page": "wiki/entities/slug.md"}
  ]
}
```

3. Tell the user per batch: `"Batch N: +{created} created, ~{updated} updated, {skipped} skipped"`

Track all pages created and updated across all batches for use in Steps 7-9.

---

## Step 7: Link Validation

For each page created or updated in this compile run (source pages from Step 5 + entity/concept pages from Step 6):

1. Read the page content
2. Find all markdown links matching the pattern `](...*.md)`
3. For each link, resolve the relative path from the page's directory and check if the target file exists using Glob
4. Collect broken links

Report as warnings — do NOT block the commit:

```
"Link warning: wiki/sources/scaling-laws.md → ../entities/kaplan-jared.md (not found)"
"N links validated, M broken."
```

If zero broken links: `"All cross-references valid."`

---

## Step 8: Update Index + Manifest

### 8a: Update wiki/index.md

Add entries for all new and updated pages. Format:

```markdown
- [{Title}](sources/{slug}.md) — {one-line description}
```

Update the page counts in section headers. Update the "Updated:" date.

### 8b: Update raw/.manifest.json

For each compiled file:
- Set `status` to `"compiled"`
- Set `source_page` to the wiki path
- Set `wiki_pages` to array of all pages created/updated for this source
- Set `compiled_at` to current ISO timestamp
- Set `sha256` to the hash from the result file

For failed files:
- Set `status` to `"failed"`
- Set `error` to the failure reason

### 8c: Clean Up

Preserve resolution traces, then remove temporary compile results:

```bash
mkdir -p wiki/.traces
```

If `raw/.compile-results/resolution-trace.json` exists, move it:

```bash
mv raw/.compile-results/resolution-trace.json wiki/.traces/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)-resolution.json
```

Then remove the temporary directory:

```bash
rm -rf raw/.compile-results/
```

### 8d: Index Tier Transition

If total wiki pages exceed 100, split index into category sub-indexes:
- `wiki/index.md` becomes a meta-index (category names + counts + links)
- Create `wiki/sources/_index.md`, `wiki/entities/_index.md`, `wiki/concepts/_index.md`, `wiki/comparisons/_index.md`

### 8e: Generate Relationship Graph

Generate a Mermaid diagram showing entity↔source↔concept relationships:

```bash
python3 tools/generate-graph.py wiki wiki/graph.mmd
```

This reads page frontmatter (key_entities, key_concepts, source_refs) and produces a visual relationship map. The graph is regenerated on every compile run.

If `tools/generate-graph.py` is not available (e.g., not copied during wiki-init), skip this step silently.

---

## Step 9: Git Commit

### 9a: Pre-commit validation pass

Before staging, validate every wiki page that changed in this run. Use `git status` to find changed paths under `wiki/`, then:

```bash
python3 tools/validate_wiki.py $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACM HEAD -- 'wiki/*.md') \
                                $(git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -- 'wiki/*.md')
```

If exit code is non-zero, **block the commit**. Report the validator output to the user and stop. Do not stage, do not commit. The user must either:
  - Manually fix the malformed pages and re-run wiki-compile (at which point validation will pass)
  - Move the offending pages to quarantine via `python3 tools/quarantine_page.py move ...`

If the wiki has any quarantined pages, surface them as a warning (do NOT block):

```bash
python3 tools/quarantine_page.py count --wiki-root wiki
```

If the count is > 0:
`"Warning: {N} pages in wiki/.quarantine/ awaiting manual review (run: python3 tools/quarantine_page.py list --wiki-root wiki)"`

### 9b: Stage and commit

Stage all changed files in `wiki/`, `raw/.manifest.json`. Single commit:

- Single file: `[compile] {source-title} | +{new} ~{updated} pages`
- Batch: `[compile] Batch: file1, file2 | +{new} ~{updated} pages`

---

## Step 10: Summary

Report compilation results to the user:

```
Compilation complete.
  Sources compiled: N
  Pages created: X (Y sources, Z entities, W concepts)
  Pages updated: M
  Failures: F (with reasons)
  Broken links: L (with details)
  Wiki total: T pages (Xs/Ye/Zc/Wn)
```
